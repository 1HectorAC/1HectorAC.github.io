                a webpage that
                displays a good understanding of javascript and jquery. The page must involve taking in an input and
                producing an output on the page. The webpage must also use html, css, and bootstrap. Assignement details can be found <a

                <div class="col-md-5    ">
                    <p class="paragraphText">I first came up with the main idea of what the page will do which was: we
                        will generate 3 numbers
                        and you must try to guess what they will be. I then came up with the basic layout in a sketch
                        and added specific details about how the page will work and what it will do on the page. General
                        ideal sketch:</p>

            <h4>3. HTML and CSS</h4>
            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p class="paragraphText">The html was mostly pretty simple and straightforward but their are a few
                        important things
                        learned. The first are about the script files. I made sure to keep the script file at the end of
                        the body tag so that everything on page loaded before it did any javascript stuff. The jquery
                        library had its own file that I need to put in and then I also included my own js file. Note
                        that the jquery file could be downloaded and referenced locally or we could use a CDN and just
                        reference the specified URL. </p>
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
&lt;script src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="logic.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
                        </code></pre>
                    <p class="paragraphText">The second key part was about how I added new elements to the page. I made
                        an empty div element
                        with the class “results” and this was important for setting up a location for which new elements
                        will be added to. </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1">
                    <p class="paragraphText">They final key part was the form setup and input element. A usefull resorce
                        in html input that
                        was very usefull was: <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input</a>.
                        When I was looking though the page I noticed that the input element can do some input validation
                        for me instead of checking it in the javascript. The input element had attributes like max and
                        min to restrict the range of values for a number type which was usefull in what I need. This is
                        can be shown here:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw2/form.PNG" alt="">
                    <br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1">
                    <p class="paragraphText">The css file didn’t have a whole lot to it. It was also a part I focused on
                        a little less given I
                        wasn't as focused on how it looked. I first wanted to adjust the size of the input boxes because
                        they were too small for just putting in one number. Everything else were pretty small changes
                        like color and alignment of elements.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw2/cssfile.PNG" alt="">

            </div>

            <h4>4. Javascript and JQuery</h4>
            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1">
                    <p class="paragraphText">I first made sure to setup all the key variables in the beginning, which I
                        find more convenient
                        in looking at what my variables were. Then I made sure to add some data validation. The html
                        input element already had some of this but one part I needed to check is if all the inputs were
                        the same and alert the user that it is invalid. This just involved an if statement and can be
                        shown here:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw2/inputVal.PNG" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1">
                    <p class="paragraphText">Then I needed to setup an array of 3 random numbers which were the keys
                        values. They also needed
                        to be check if any were equal to each other and changed if so. This check was also differently
                        than the input validation involving duplicate numbers since if this part had a duplicate then I
                        had to change values rather than just give a warning. The code can be seen here:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw2/randNum.PNG" alt=""><br /><br />

                <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1">
                    <p class="paragraphText">Now that I had valid inputs and keys I then had to write the logic to
                        compare them which was just
                        a straight forward comparison of each value:</p>

                    <p class="paragraphText">I finally just outputed everything I had(note: I added that last line to
                        prevent the page from
                        just going back to default and restarting after running. It was relevant on how the event was
                        being handled using jquery):</p>
