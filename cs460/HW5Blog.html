            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>The main objective is to write an MVC web application that uses a one table local database. The web
                application will have a page to make request to the landlord though a form online and a page to view all
                requests in the database. Here is a link to the full assignment details: <a

            <h4>Step 1 (Setup): </h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>The first think I did was setup the home page. I pretty much just set up the links I will need and
                stylised it a bit to look good. I Decided to make a orange-reddish color as the basis for the website.
                Not much else happened here. The _Layout page is also had a few cosmetic changes that aren't really
                worth mentioning.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 2 (Database Setup):</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>So I I created the database by opening the SQL object explorer in visual studio. There I just
                rightclickled on the local database location and made a database called TennantInfo. I then made the
                up.sql and down.sql in the App_Data. The code were pretty simple and similar to the examples in class so
                I won't mention much else about them.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 3 (Code):</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1">
                    <h5><i>TennantRequest.cs:</i></h5>
                    <p>This file was the model to represent a request. It was saved in the model folder. Not much
                        difficulty in this part. The most notable part here where the data annotations that the
                        variables had. One problem that I came across in this part was using the “phone” data
                        annotation. At first I thought thought that this would be enough to validate the phone number
                        variable but that wasn’t the case. It pretty much only made sure the right characters were used.
                        I then had to use regular expressions to format it more to US standards. This was especially
                        important because I think It had no limit of on the length of characters before. Here is how
                        snippet on the variables and data annotations were formatted:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img src="images/hw5Images/model%20snip.PNG" class="formatedImage" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6 offset-md-1">
                    <h5><i>TennantRequestContext.cs:</i></h5>
                    <p>This file was the database context class that had the connection to the database and a collection
                        of the TennentRequest model. Not much to write in this part.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img src="images/hw5Images/context.PNG" class="formatedImage" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <h5><i>Web.Config:</i></h5>
                    <p> I then had to set up the string connection to actually connect to the database I made. This was
                        as simple as just going to the web.config file and pasting this code:</p>
                    <p>Note that the connection string was taken by going to the SQL object explorer, right clicking on
                        the database, selecting properties, and copying the string connection from there.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-7">
                    <img src="images/hw5Images/webConfig.PNG" class="formatedImage" alt="">
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <h5><i>HomeController.cs:</i></h5>
                    <p>This part had the way to setup the views. A key part here was how a context was passed to the
                        view. A clear example is shown in the “Display” action method.</p>
                    <p>Another important part was the the section involved in the Create action method, specifically the
                        POST one. It contained some checks for the variable it was passed. It also had a redirect call
                        when things went as planned. Here is the example:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="images/hw5Images/HC%20display.PNG" class="formatedImage" alt="">
                    <img src="images/hw5Images/HC%20create.PNG" class="formatedImage" alt="">
                    <br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <h5><i>Create.cshtml:</i></h5>
                    <p>The notable part here was how I used lambda functions to set up the form elements with razor
                        html. Here is an example of one of the form elements created this way.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="images/hw5Images/create.PNG" class="formatedImage" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col md-6">
                    <br />
                    <h5><i>Display.cshtml:</i></h5>
                    <p>The important part here was how the items in the TennantRequests list were looped though and
                        displayed involving a lambda functions. Here are a few examples:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img src="images/hw5Images/display.PNG" class="formatedImage" alt="">

                </div>
            </div>
            <br />
