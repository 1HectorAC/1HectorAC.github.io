                    homework 8) and database on
                    azure. Assignment details can be found <a

                <hr class="whiteLine" />
                <p class="paragraphText">The first part of this assignment involved making an Azure account. This part
                    of the assignment was
                    pretty simple and doesn't need any more explaining than that. I then used the Azure portal to make a
                    resource group and then a server/database. That part was also pretty easy and just involved looking
                    in
                    the left side bar for “resource group” or “sql databases” and then hitting the “add” button on the
                    top
                    of the page. After that there was a small prompt for details like naming, plan, and other small
                    things.

                        <p class="paragraphText">The next step was to add a firewall rule. The steps I took to do this
                            were to go to the Azure
                            portal, hit the resource group side tab, click on my resource group for the project, click
                            on
                            the server used for the project, click on the “show firewall setting” and then just adding
                            the
                            firewall rule. Image shows the rule added. Also IP Adresses are covered in red.</p>

                            field I added the name of my azure server (can be found on Azure portal by clicking on the
                            database which should display a server name on the page), made sure it was with sql
                            authentication and then just added the server login info. I proceeded to go to my “up.sql”
                            script and ran to the database from Azure. Image shows me connecting to it:</p>

                            pretty straight forward and had us chose the web app we created on azure to deploy on. Then
