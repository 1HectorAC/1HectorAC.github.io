            <h4>Assignment Summary</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>The main objective is make a MVC web application using a pre-existing database. We
                will use as Code First with an Existing Database workflow. The program will involve looking up
                information about a person from a database from a search of their name. The full details of the
                assignment can be found here: <a
                    href="http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW6_1819.html">http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW6_1819.html</a>

            <h4>Step 1 (Setup): </h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>The first thing I needed to do was to download microsoft sql server management studio and sql express. I
                use them to restore the database that the assignment page has a link to download, which we will use for
                this assignment. Then I used Nuget to add microsoft.SqlServer.Types and entity framework. I also
                downloaded LinqPad5. Then I proceeded to restore the database.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 2 (Linq Query):</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>I then began messing around with linq query searches with LinqPad5 before writing any code. Somethings
                that I really took note of is to notice when a search will give you a single object of something or a
                list of them and making sure the next command adheres to that. I eventually just looked up every query I
                was sure to use in the assignment. I will not show them here since they will just be shown in the code
                in later parts of the blog.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 3 (Search Name):</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>This part is just how the name was being searched.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <h5><i>HomeController.cs:</i></h5>
                    <p>So I need the logic to to take in a searched name and then returned at least a list of names to
                        display to the index view. I pretty much just looked through the SearchName of the Person table
                        in the database and matched any that fit and then passed that list of people to the index view.
                    </p>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw6Images/HCIndex.PNG" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>Step 4 (Display Information):</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>To display information on the searched person I used POST and passed an id number. The page has access to
                the person ID number since I passed in a list of people in the previous part.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <h5><i>Index.cshtml:</i></h5>
                    <p>So this page pretty much just has the form setup. Not much else to it.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw6Images/index.PNG" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h5><i>PersonDashboardVM.cs:</i></h5>
                    <p>So before I get into the HomeController logic of calling a view with a model contain all the
                        information need to display I needed to make a View Model. </p>
                    <p>This View model just holds all the variables I will need to display so it won't be necessary to
                        show the code. This is needed since I will need information from multiple models and you can
                        only pass one model to the view. Note that I also made another View Model containing purchase
                        Information for a profitable purchased Item. I needed a list of these in the PersonDashboardVM
                        since I need to store 10 of them.</p>
                    <br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <h5><i>HomeController.cs:</i></h5>
                    <p>So the Detail Action to get the Detail view is where most of the query searches and logic is. It
                        is a Post and takes in an ID. So we Initialize the a PersonDashboardVM object to store all the
                        information. We always store the personal information so that was done entered in first.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw6Images/HCDetail1.PNG" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <p>The second half of the assignment has a few checks to see if it requires more information to be
                        stored. Specifically I checked If certain IDs matched and whether custormer2 was null.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw6Images/HCDetail2.PNG" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <p>A notable part was setting up the top 10 profitable items list. I pretty much made a query search
                        to set up a list of the top 10 most profitable items and then looped though it to put them In my
                        model. I feel like this part could have been more efficient but it works.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <img class="formatedImage" src="images/hw6Images/HCDetail3.PNG" alt=""><br /><br />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <h5><i>Detail.cshtml:</i></h5>
                    <p>This part just displays all the parts of the PersonDashboardMV model that It needs to show using
                        razor html and lambda functions. One thing to note is that I use one “if” check so see if the
                        companyName variable in the model is null, this is because to display the second half I need to
                        know if the second half was filled in so checking just the company name should be fine is
                        assuming the second half was in fact filled in.</p>
