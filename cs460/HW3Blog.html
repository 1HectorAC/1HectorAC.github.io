            <p class="paragraphText">The goal of this assignment is to translate the code of a java file into a C# file.
                The file must follow
                C# standards, must be properly commented, and should run the same as the java when executed. Assignement details
                and code for the java file can be found <a

            <h4>1. Setting Up</h4>
            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <p class="paragraphText">The first thing we had to do was to download and install the visual studio IDE. I
                already had it on my
                laptop from over a year ago when I was trying to learn to make Unity games and installed visual studio
                to write C# files. That saved me some time. My experience using C# wasn't that amazing considering I
                just learned what I needed at the time and I didn't have much of a foundation.
            </p>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>2. Java Code</h4>
            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <p class="paragraphText">I dont have a whole lot of experience with java but I have learned it a while back
                on my own so reading
                the code shouldn't be much trouble. Looking at the java code it doesn't look like there is a whole lot
                that will be different in the C# file. Most of the file are pretty simple and straightforward. The Main
                file is probably the only part that requires a bit of thinking to understand but it isn't that bad
                either. I will largely take note of differences that will need to be resolved in translating the file.

                <div class="col-md-7">
                    <p class="paragraphText">The big difference here was just setting up a property to get and set the
                        data variable, which
                        was changed to private. The code is pretty simple and accessing data is as easy as calling the
                        "Data" instead of directly with "data".</p>
                </div>

            <h5><i>4.b QueueInterface.java to IQueue.cs</i></h5>
            <p class="paragraphText">The big difference here was the file name change. In C# it was more proper to start
                interfaces
                with "I".

            <h5><i>4.c QueueUnderflowException.java to QueueUnderflowException.cs</i></h5>

                    <p class="paragraphText">Some differences that I came across where how to extend a class. They
                        didn't have much of a
                        difference with C# using a “:” instead of an “extends”. Calling the extended classes constructor
                        was also a bit different with a different keyword and location to place it.
                    </p>

            </div>
            <h5><i>4.d LinkedQueue.java to LinkedQueue.cs</i></h5>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-8">
                    <p class="paragraphText">This file had a difference in implementing an interface by using “:”
                        instead of “implements”.
                        Another thing that I learned was the difference in exception types (or names of them) from java
                        and C#. I had to look up a list of exception of C# to know what was available to use. This site
                        was usefull in figuring out which to use: <a
                            href="https://www.developerfusion.com/article/1889/exception-handling-in-c/3/">https://www.developerfusion.com/article/1889/exception-handling-in-c/3/.</a>
                        I also noticed that in c# you can’t set a generic type to null unlike in java. This solution
                        involved just setting the variable to default(type) instead of a null value. Like this:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
T tmp = default(T);
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h5><i>4.e Main.java to Program.cs</i></h5>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p class="paragraphText">The first thing to note is that the file that was first generated by visual
                        studio ended up being
                        called Program instead of main so the file names ended up changing.
                        One thing that was slightly different was the method names in their built in linked list. I also
                        noticed that I couldn't find a method to directly return the element of the last node (like in
                        the java code) but instead had to access the last node and had to access the element from there.
                        I used this site as a reference for C# linkedlist: <a
                            href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlist-1?view=netframework-4.7.2">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.linkedlist-1?view=netframework-4.7.2</a>
                        Here is the diff:
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
int maxLength = output.Last.Value.Length; //C#
Vs
int maxLength = output.getLast().length(); //Java
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="paragraphText">Then there was a couple small syntaxial difference like using Console.WriteLine()
                instead of
                System.out.println() to outputted in command line and name changes that aren't really worth
                mentioning considering how trivial they are.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-7">

                    <p class="paragraphText">Some general things that were noted were xml comments for classes and
                        functions. This was done by
                        typing “///” a line above from the target. Then I just filled out the areas with descriptions of
                        the specified area.
