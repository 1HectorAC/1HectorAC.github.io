            <p>
                This is a website about saving money. There are 3 pages with a different money spending calculator. Each
                page will take in input numbers and produces an output value(s) as a result. I will talk about some of
                the key features I worked on below. Link to the git hub repositiory <a

                    <p>To quickly get react running there were a few thing that needed to be installed. I personally ran
                        it on
                        windows using Windows Linux Subsystem. Here is a link that was useful in setting everything up.

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>After everything is installed, I opened a wls terminal and created the project using the command
                        shown. It will generate all the necessary files to get started.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>Then you can just run the code below to start the server:</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>I also made a "pages" and "components" folder in the home directory. Pages will contain web pages
                        and components will contain section that can be reused.</p>

                    <br />
                    <p>One of the first parts I worked on was the path routing. I pretty much just went to the App.js
                        file and added the routes. The code was pretty simple. Example code of the routing is shown.
                        Every time a new route is needed it just involves making another route element with a
                        "path" and "element" fields. The "element" field in the code just refers to a components that is
                        imported from another file and the "path" part is just the name of the path.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
// Routes in App.js file.
import { BrowserRouter,Routes,Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Page1 from './pages/Page1';
import Page2 from './pages/Page2';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
        &lt;Routes&gt;
            &lt;Route index element={&lt;Page1/&gt;} /&gt;
            &lt;Route path="/Page2" element={&lt;Page2/&gt;} /&gt;
        &lt;/Routes&gt;
      &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

                <div class="col-md-7">
                    <br />
                    <p>The next part I will mention is how the nav bar was setup. This part involves wrapping the routes
                        in another "route" tag with a closing tag. This "route" tag will link to the component that
                        contains the nav bar. In this case I called it "Layout" and its path is set to "/". Example
                        shown.</p>

                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>I should also mention that the Layout page will also need a "&lt;Outlet/&gt;" tag at the end of
                        the components return with its related library reference at the top. </p>

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <p>I wanted to show a quick example of separating components given that it is a key part of react.
                        Here is an example of making a component using Javascript arrow function:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
// Example component in Test.js file:
Const Test = () => {
    return (
        &lt;&gt;
        // More code Here.
        &lt;/&gt;
    )
};
export default Test;
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>Then you can import the component in another file. Code shown:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
import Test from '../pages/Test';
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>Th code is pretty similar if done inline. You just donâ€™t need to export it.
                        This sort of idea is applied throughout the application to not only separate the code of pages
                        but also to separate reusable part. It can also be used to just separate different section.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br />
            <h4>Step 5 (Calculators):</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12">
                    <p>There are 3 calcualtors on this website. The first is about calculating the saving from a
                        percentage off sale. The second one involves calculating the tip cost based on a certain
                        percentage. The final one is just understanding the savings from a buy 2 get 1 free. All the
                        calculators have pretty similar code so I will just talk about the feature from the first one
                        called "SaleCalculator."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>
                        <br />
                        The SaleCalculator will first take in two numbers, cost of the item and the percentage off. I
                        setup hooks to control the state of these numbers and setup an "onchange" event to an input that
                        control their value. The hook is shown at the top of the SaleCalculator component. I also added
                        some number validation to restrict the value size. Below is some example code of what I have
                        mentioned. The code is only for the cost but is nearly identical for percentage off.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
// Select parts of SaleCalculator.js
import { useState } from "react";

const SaleCalculator = () => {
    const [cost, setCost] = useState(0);
    
    function changeCost(e) {
        let input = Number(e.target.value);
        if (input > 1000000)
            e.target.value = input = 1000000;
        else if (input &lt; 0)
            e.target.value = input = 0;
        setCost(input);
    }

            // Display results section
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}
                    </code></pre>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p>The final part is to display the results. With the "cost" and "percentage" variables set as a
                        state I can reference the variables on the page and if the variables get update then the
                        reference that is display also get updated. Note that there variables can only be reference in
                        the html part with curly brackets. No I can just add the variables and calculations at the end
                        of the page after the input section. I also restricted the length of the number to 2 decimal
                        places to make it easier to see using the toFixed method. Example shown:</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
// Display result section in SaleCalculator.
&lt;p&gt;(Cost - Saving = New Cost)&lt;/p&gt;
{cost.toFixed(2)} - {(percentage / 100 * cost).toFixed(2)} = {(cost - percentage / 100 * cost).toFixed(2)}
                    </code></pre>

            <h4>Final Thoughts:</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>Something I really like about react is the component focused organization of part. It's really easy to do
                and just makes thing easier to read. There are also some performance improvements that I thought were
                pretty interesting involving in not reloading the whole page but just section. I will say that even
                though getting started is pretty easy there are a lot of parts that require a bit more knowledge to do
                well and efficiently. I really needed to understand how react.js works in order to use it well. One
                thing I might want to try next time is to use more Javascript libraries in conjunction with react to
                make more complex web apps. </p>
