            <h4 id="gameSection">1. Game Section Transitions</h4>
            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <p class="paragraphText">One of the first key aspects I needed to figure out was transition content sections
                (settings, playing,
                and game over.) My initial idea was to delete and create the sections using Javascript as needed using
                forms. The problem I ran into was that this would put too much of the html in Javascript. Setting up a
                bunch of html elements in Javascript made it a bit had to read/edit and also felt like Javascript should
                be focus more the logic related action and not so much content creation. My solution was to keep all the
                sections (settings, playing, and game over) in the html. Each section would be identified with an id and
                a form. I would then hide the sections that weren't being used yet. After that I would use Javascript to
                hide/show sections depending on the form being submitted.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraphText">
                For example, let us say the setting section is the only section showing right now. When you hit the play
                button a form is submitted, the Javascript will handle it based on the forms id (which would be a
                setting form), and after some work is done the setting section will become hidden and the play
                section(which is identified by id) will be shown.
                Here is some sample code on how this works:
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-7">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
//Html Part:
&lt;form id="settingSection"&gt;
    //setting content
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Play" class="btn customButton"&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;form id="gameSection" style="display:none"&gt;
    //game content
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Next" class="btn customButton"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
                    </code></pre>

                </div>
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <pre class="codeBlockPanel"><code>
//Javascript Part:
$("form#settingSection").submit(function(e){
	...
	$('#settingSection').hide();
    	$('#gameSection').show();
});

                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <p class="paragraphText">Another part that every game will share is how setting are setup. This part

                        the setting section there will be dropdown buttons for various settings. When the enter button
                        is pressed and the form is submitted then the Javascript part handling that specific form will
                        set the values of the dropdown to a variable that will be used later. Example code:</p>
                </div>

    &lt;/select&gt;
    ... more settings here
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Play"&gt;

            <p class="paragraphText">The first game I worked on was a basic math operations game. In the game, the user
                chooses a math
                operation (+,-, or *), total problems, and a number range(0-99.) After the settings are selected the
                user is given a specified number of math problems using the math operation selected. A math problem is
                shown with a textbox for an answer. When the enter button is selected the next problem is shown until
                the game ends. At the end the users is shown how well they did.</p>

                        considered just generating math problems as they are being answered one after another but I also
                        wanted the user to be able to review their answers and this approach didn’t handle that. I then
                        decided to generate all the math problems beforehand and store them in an array called
                        "problemList." Each element in this array would be another array of 3 values (2 random numbers
                        and the result of the problem.) I also kept the users answers in an array called "answerList.".
                        The users answer gets pushed to this list as they are being entered. With these two array I
                        would now be able to track and show how well the user did.</p>

                    <p class="paragraphText">Another important aspect was showing the correctness of an answer. After a
                        user enters an answer
                        I wanted to not only show the actual answer with the user answer below it but I also wanted to
                        highlight how much of the users string was correct with color. I wanted to color the user
                        answers green based on how accurate it was and when the string starts to differ then it color
                        the rest red. I first wanted to account for a shorter string by appending underscores to the
                        users answer if it has a smaller length than the actual answer. Then I use a function I made
                        called DifferenceIndex (code shown below) to find the index point at which the user answer
                        differentiates from the actual answer. From there I create two substrings based on the index
                        point with one side being the correct part and the other being the incorrect part. I already had
                        two html elements with their color already adjusted so I just set the text after there.</p>

                        one play. In the Javascript, color boxes are represented as an array of strings with each color
                        being and element in the array. The index will represent which box it is associated with. So to
                        randomize the color placements I just shuffle the values of the array with a function I created
                        called ShuffleArray (code shown below.)</p>

                        So the first thing it
                        involves is generating a random color. Now since the colors are represented in an array then I
                        would just need to get a random number from 0 to the total colors used. This can be done with
                        the Math.random method. Then I would need a way to handle pressing the boxes and checking if it
                        matched the random color. This can be done in Javascript by listening for the right button based
                        on the class (each box will have an identifying class.) When a box is pressed, the main logic
                        will run and a color index parameter whose value is based on the button will also be passed. So
                        with the random color index and the pressed color index we can now just compare the two to see
                        if the box pressed was correct.

            <p class="paragraphText">An important idea I tried to keep in mind was separating logic from content. Something like this is easy
                to forget when you just work on html and Javascript. This sort of thing just make the code easier to
                read and understand. In the future I might also want to think about how I setup variables in Javascript
                more. I tried to minimize how many variables I had to avoid confusion but I still ran into some problem
                that might be handled better next time. For example, it was difficult at time to track how a variables
                changes over time when they are all over the place.</p>
