                        This a C# console app that runs 2 versions of finding the largest number in an array. There is a
                        sequential and parallel version. It will run the algorithms with different array sizes and
                        prints the
                        time it takes to run. I will talk about some of the key features in the program. Link to the git

            <h4>1. Sequential Version</h4>
            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <p class="paragraphText">The sequential version doesnâ€™t require a whole lot of explaining. It involves a for
                loop to iterate over
                every value in the array to find the largest one.</p>
            <br /><br />
            <h4>2. Parallel Version:</h4>
            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-5">
                    <p class="paragraphText">The most important thing to understand in the parallel version is the
                        Parallel.For loop. The
                        Parallel.For loop will take in 3 values. The first 2 are integers that determined the start and
                        end of the loop. This is pretty much how many sections we can split and run in parallel. The
                        third
                        argument is just a delegate that will be ran by each iteration. It is important to make this
                        part a repeatable sub problem that can be ran on section of the problem to solve the overall
                        problem. This concept is key in data parallelism. The code I wrote is splitting the problem by
                        the number of processors (arraySize/Chunk will end up being the number processors). Each
                        processors is
                        then doing a loop through their section of the array to find the largest and setting it.</p>

            <hr class="whiteLine" />
            <p class="paragraphText">The results involve running the sequential and parallel version with various array
                sizes and recoding the
                times. Console results:</p>

            <p class="paragraphText">I will mention there is a minor flaw in my code that involves not locking. It
                doesn't really impact the
                results in most cases but it is something I will look at more in a later project.</p>
