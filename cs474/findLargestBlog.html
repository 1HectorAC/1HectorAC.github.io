            <p>
                This a C# console app that runs 2 versions of finding the largest number in an array. There is a
                sequential and parallel version. It will run the algorithms with different array sizes and prints the
                time it takes to run. I will talk about some of the key features in the program. Link to the git hub repositiory section <a
                href="https://github.com/1HectorAC/CS474/tree/master/CS474FindLargest">here.</a>

                    <hr style="background-color: white;" />
                    <p>The goals was to get started with data parallelism using C#.

                    <hr style="background-color: white;" />
                    <p>I used the programming language C# and the IDE Visual Studio.

            <h4>Sequential Version:</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>The sequential version doesnâ€™t require a whole lot of explaining. It involves a for loop to iterate over
                every value in the array to find the largest one.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Parallel Version:</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-6">
                    <br />
                    <p>The most important thing to understand in the parallel version is the Parallel.For loop. The
                        Parallel.For loop will take in 3 values. The first 2 are integers that determined the start and
                        end of the loop. This is pretty much how many sections we can split and run in parallel. The
                        third
                        argument is just a delegate that will be ran by each iteration. It is important to make this
                        part a repeatable sub problem that can be ran on section of the problem to solve the overall
                        problem. This concept is key in data parallelism. The code I wrote is splitting the problem by
                        the number of processors (arraySize/Chunk will end up being the number processors). Each
                        processors is
                        then doing a loop through their section of the array to find the largest and setting it.</p>

//Parallel Version of Find Largest:

    int largestNum = array[0];

    {
        //Calculate location of chunk.
        int iSize = i * chunk;
        //Loop though a chunk of the array.
        for (int j = iSize; j &lt; (iSize + chunk); j++)
            if (array[j] &gt; largestNum)
                largestNum = array[j];
    });
    return largestNum;

            <h4>Results:</h4>
            <hr style="background-color: white;" />
            <p>The results involve running the sequential and parallel version with various array sizes and recoding the
                times. Console results:</p>

            <br/>
            <p>I will mention there is a minor flaw in my code that involves not locking. It doesn't really impact the
                results in most cases but it is something I will look at more in a later project.</p>
